                 <p><b>Brainhack 2020 Beijing & Nanning</b> will focus its events on the translational applications of the brain growth charts. We are thus inviting all the researchers to participate this event and practice the open science. As a basic resource, the normative data of the brain development across school age will be opened to all the participants who submit a relevant project. This is a one-week hack event including sessions for education course, project team building and summarizing report. </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of Brainhack is to bridge the data science and neuroscience research
                    communities to advance the progress of brain science research. Brainhack is a unique
                    conference that convenes researchers from across the globe and myriad disciplines to
                    work together on innovative projects related to neuroscience.

ComBat (named for \combining batches") is an empirical Bayesian method for data harmonization that was originallydesigned for genomics (Johnson et al., 2007). It has recently been adapted to neuroimaging studies and applied to diverse data types including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Fortin et al., 2017), cortical thicknesses (Fortinet al., 2018), functional connectivity measurements (Yu et al., 2018), and radiomic

                        <h4>Details</h4>
                        <p>Functional homotopy, the high degree of synchrony in spontaneous activity between geometrically corresponding interhemispheric regions, is a fundamental characteristic of the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. An opposite concept is “functional specialization”. Brain functional specialization emphasizes hemispheric processing, which allows the expanded human brain to minimize between-hemisphere connectivity and distribute domain-specific processing functions. The improvement in functional specialization between hemispheres may enhance the efficiency of cognitive processing. Through the evaluation of functional specialization, the specific cognitive ability can be predicted to some extent. 
                            Generally, schoolchildren are a group which is highly concerned by the society. However, rare studies have been conducted to directly examine the development of functional homotopy or functional specialization and their relationship with cognitive performance in this group. Describing the development trajectory of functional specialization in healthy schoolchildren is helpful to identify children with cognitive developmental defects. Although it is well-established that human language functions are mostly lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain, little is known about the development of such functional specialization. Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), a method that quantifies the resting-state FC between each voxel in one hemisphere and its corresponding voxel in the opposite hemisphere, can be used to evaluate the functional specialization between the two hemispheres. In this project, we aim to depict the developmental trajectories of functional specialization in schoolchildren. At the same time, the functional specialization development in verbal related areas and its relationship with verbal intelligence will be evaluated. 
                            Through the project, you will gain a basic understanding of the development pattern of functional connectivity between hemispheres and how they can be related to cognitive development, as well as the use of Generalized Additive Mixed Models in longitudinal studies.</p>
